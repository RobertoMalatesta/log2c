* Of course make it able to bootstrap again (now on X86-64).
* use a mechanism to search for libraries/moduels in others directories
* Add the new predicates of ISO Cor2
* Add the new arithmetic functions of ISO Cor2
* Reformat all the C code
* Reformat all the Prolog code
* Partly undo the "trad" part:
	- to have access to the generated virtual instructions
	- to move all the C code formating out of the prolog code and use C macros instead
* Add tests! (maybe even use plunit)
* Add indexing support!
* type testing on argument: pred(A) :- atom(A), ... % the atom(A) should really belong to the compilation of the head like a sort of generic getatom abd should be part of the 1st level indexation
* macro/expand meta predicates like maplist in order to avoid the (repeated) cost of doing dynamic call()
